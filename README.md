OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## CI Pipeline

This project implements a **DevSecOps CI pipeline** using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), embedding security controls directly into the software delivery process. The pipeline is triggered on every `git push` and orchestrates six jobs across two stages — a parallel security and test stage, followed by a gated image delivery stage. No Docker image is built or published unless all upstream jobs complete successfully.

### Pipeline Overview

```
git push
    │
    ├── create_cache    ← Dependency installation & caching (node_modules / .yarn)
    │       │
    │   yarn_test       ← Unit test execution (needs create_cache)
    │       │
    ├── gitleaks        ← Secret scanning across full git history (continue-on-error)
    ├── njsscan         ← SAST: Node.js vulnerability analysis, results uploaded as SARIF
    ├── semgrep         ← SAST: Multi-language static analysis
    │       │
    └───────┴── build_image  ← Docker build & push (needs yarn_test + gitleaks + njsscan + semgrep)
```

![CI Pipeline Run](screenshots/sast-ci-pipeline.png)

### Jobs

| Job | Runtime | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `create_cache` | `node:18-bullseye` | Runs `yarn install` and caches `node_modules` and `.yarn` keyed to the `yarn.lock` hash to accelerate downstream jobs |
| `yarn_test` | `node:18-bullseye` | Restores the dependency cache and executes the full test suite via `yarn test` |
| `gitleaks` | `zricethezav/gitleaks:latest` | Scans the complete git history for hardcoded secrets and credentials (`continue-on-error: true`) |
| `njsscan` | `ajinabraham/njsscan-action@master` | Performs Node.js-specific SAST, outputs findings in SARIF format and uploads results to GitHub Code Scanning |
| `semgrep` | `semgrep/semgrep` | Runs multi-language static analysis via `semgrep ci` against configured rulesets |
| `build_image` | `docker:24` (DinD) | Builds the Docker image and pushes `ndubuisip/demo-app:juice-shop-1.2` to Docker Hub only after all upstream jobs complete |

### Gitleaks — Secret Scanning

Gitleaks scans every commit in the repository history for hardcoded secrets such as API keys, passwords, and tokens. It runs in parallel with `create_cache` and does not block the pipeline due to `continue-on-error: true`, but its findings are visible in the GitHub Actions log and must be reviewed and remediated.

An initial scan of this repository across 27 commits (~9.15 MB) detected **43 leaks** across multiple files, flagged under the following rule violations:

| Rule | Files affected |
|---|---|
| `generic-api-key` | `data/static/users.yml`, `routes/login.ts`, `test/api/*`, `frontend/src/app/*` |
| `jwt` | `test/server/verifySpec.ts`, `test/server/currentUserSpec.ts`, `test/cypress/integration/e2e/forgedJwt.spec.ts` |
| `private-key` | `lib/insecurity.ts` |

![Gitleaks Findings](screenshots/gitleaks-findings.png)

### Handling False Positives — `.gitleaks.toml`

Many of the 43 findings were in test files (`test/`, `*.spec.ts`) which contain intentional mock credentials used for testing purposes — these are **false positives**. To suppress them, a `.gitleaks.toml` configuration file was created at the root of the repository.

```toml
[extend]
useDefault = true

[allowlist]
paths = ['test', '.*\/test\/.*']
```

**What this does:**
- `useDefault = true` — extends the built-in gitleaks default ruleset
- `paths` allowlist — excludes any file under a `test` directory from being scanned

After applying the configuration, a re-scan across **29 commits (~9.15 MB)** reduced findings from **43 → 10 leaks**, isolating only real secrets in production code such as `lib/insecurity.ts` and `routes/login.ts`.

![Gitleaks False Positive Handling](screenshots/gitleaks-false-positive.png)

### SAST — Static Application Security Testing

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyses source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the application. Two complementary SAST tools run in parallel on every push, each targeting different vulnerability classes.

#### njsscan

`njsscan` is a Node.js-specific SAST tool built on top of libsast and semgrep patterns. It analyses the JavaScript/TypeScript source code for insecure coding patterns, dangerous API usage, and known vulnerability signatures.

**CI job behaviour:**
- Uses the `ajinabraham/njsscan-action@master` GitHub Action
- Scans the entire codebase with `--sarif --output results.sarif --exit-warning`
- `--exit-warning` means the job exits with a warning (non-zero) on findings rather than a hard failure
- Results are uploaded to **GitHub Code Scanning** via `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`, making findings visible in the repository's **Security → Code scanning** tab
- Requires `permissions: security-events: write` to upload SARIF results

![njsscan CI Results](screenshots/njsscan-results.png)

#### semgrep

`semgrep` is a fast, open-source static analysis engine that supports multiple languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more. It runs against configured rulesets to detect security anti-patterns, misconfigurations, and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

**CI job behaviour:**
- Runs inside the official `semgrep/semgrep` container
- Executes `semgrep ci` which applies the configured ruleset
- Non-blocking by default — the job succeeds even when findings exist unless `--no-suppress-errors` is passed
- Findings are reported in the GitHub Actions log for developer review

![semgrep CI Results](screenshots/semgrep-results.png)

### Pre-Commit Hook — Local Secret Scanning

To catch secrets **before** they are committed and pushed to the remote repository, a git pre-commit hook runs gitleaks locally on every `git commit`.

#### How It Works

```
git commit
    │
    └── .git/hooks/pre-commit  ← runs automatically before the commit is recorded
            │
            ├── docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
            └── docker run gitleaks detect --source="/path" --verbose
                    │
                    ├── leaks found  → commit is blocked (exit code 1)
                    └── no leaks     → commit proceeds
```

#### Setup

1. Create the hook file:
```bash
vim .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

2. Add the following content:
```bash
docker pull zricethezav/gitleaks:latest
export path_to_host_folder_to_scan=/home/ndu/DevSecOps/juice-shop
docker run -v ${path_to_host_folder_to_scan}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect --source="/path" --verbose
```

3. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### Why This Matters

The pre-commit hook acts as the **first line of defence** — stopping secrets from ever entering the git history. This is earlier and cheaper than catching them in the CI pipeline, since secrets in git history require a full history rewrite to fully remove.

| Layer | Where | Blocks commit? |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-commit hook | Local machine, before `git commit` | Yes (exit code 1) |
| CI gitleaks job | GitHub Actions, after `git push` | No (`continue-on-error: true`) |

> **Note:** `.git/hooks/` is not tracked by git. Each developer must set up the hook manually on their local machine.

### Why This CI Process Matters

**1. Security Shifted Left**
Security controls — secret scanning (`gitleaks`), Node.js SAST (`njsscan`), and multi-language static analysis (`semgrep`) — execute on every push, at the earliest possible point in the delivery lifecycle. Vulnerabilities are identified and surfaced to developers before code reaches production, where remediation cost is significantly higher.

**2. Defence in Depth**
No single tool catches every vulnerability class. The pipeline layers complementary controls:
- `gitleaks` — detects hardcoded secrets and credentials in git history
- `njsscan` — identifies Node.js-specific insecure coding patterns and dangerous API usage
- `semgrep` — performs broad static analysis across multiple languages against security rulesets

**3. Faster Builds with Dependency Caching**
`create_cache` runs first and stores installed dependencies keyed to the `yarn.lock` hash. All downstream jobs restore from this cache, eliminating redundant installs and reducing total pipeline duration.

**4. Gated Image Delivery**
`build_image` has a hard dependency on all upstream jobs (`needs: [yarn_test, gitleaks, njsscan, semgrep]`). A Docker image is only built and published after tests pass and all security scans have completed — ensuring only verified code reaches the container registry.

**5. Audit Trail and Visibility**
`njsscan` uploads findings as SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning, providing a persistent, queryable record of security findings per commit. Every pipeline run is fully logged in GitHub Actions, creating a clear audit trail of the security posture of each release.

**6. Consistent, Reproducible Environments**
Every job executes inside a purpose-built container (`node:18-bullseye`, `docker:24`, `semgrep/semgrep`, `zricethezav/gitleaks`). This eliminates environment drift and ensures scan and build results are identical regardless of who triggers the pipeline.
